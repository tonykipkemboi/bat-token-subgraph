# BAT Token Subgraph
This is code that I used to generate a sugraph for the BRAVE Token a.k.a. $BAT

Check out the subgraph here: https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/tonykipkemboi/bat-token

If the link does not work, that means the subgraph has not been queried for the past 30 days and I would have to redeploy it again. Open an issue if you would like me to redeploy in this case.
